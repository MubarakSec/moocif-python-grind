# Task: Solve quadratic equation axÂ²+bx+c 
# using quadratic formula, print both real roots;
# assume two real roots always


# Let's take the square root of math-module in use
from math import sqrt

# Note that the square root can also be calculated using power.
# sqrt(9) is equivalent to 9 ** 0.5
