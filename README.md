This repo is my personal log while grinding through the **Mooc.fi Python course** (Helsinki Uni).  
I’m not here to copy-paste. I’m here to **understand, break, rebuild** — then move on.

### 🚀 Goals:
- Master Python syntax and logic.
- Build strong foundations for cybersecurity tools and automation.
- Document my grind publicly to track growth and stay sharp.

## ⚔️ Notes:
This isn't tutorial-code. This is **combat code**.
- Each folder = real effort
- Each part = real grind
- Each commit = real growth

Final goal: transition from exercises to **real-world tools & scripts**.

## 🧠 After Mooc.fi?
Once I wrap up Part 7:
- Start building mini tools using what I learned.
- Pivot to applying Python in **cybersecurity**, scripting, and automation.
