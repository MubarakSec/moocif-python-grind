# üìò Part 2 ‚Äì Intermediate Python: Programming Terminology, Conditionals & Loops

This section dives deeper into Python syntax and control structures. We refine our understanding of conditionals, typecasting, combining conditions, and simple loop logic. The goal is to become comfortable with writing decision-making logic and simple input/output cycles.
