# 📘 Part 2 – Intermediate Python: Programming Terminology, Conditionals & Loops

This section dives deeper into Python syntax and control structures. We refine our understanding of conditionals, typecasting, combining conditions, and simple loop logic. The goal is to become comfortable with writing decision-making logic and simple input/output cycles.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Programming terminology & syntax  
- Typecasting basics  
- Conditional statements (if/else)  
- Combining logical conditions (and/or)  
- Input validation  
- While loops with conditions

## 🧠 Exercises Breakdown

### 🧩 Programming Terminology
1. **Fix the syntax** – Practice identifying and correcting basic syntax errors.  
2. **Number of characters** – Use `len()` to count characters in strings.  
3. **Typecasting** – Convert between strings and integers using `int()` and `str()`.

---

### 🔀 More Conditionals
1. **Age of maturity** – Simple `if` condition to check if someone is an adult.  
2. **Greater than or equal to** – Check numeric conditions using `>=`.  
3. **The elder** – Compare two values and print the larger one.  
4. **Alphabetically last** – Compare string values based on alphabetical order.

---

### 🧩 Combining Conditions
1. **Age check** – Use `and` to ensure a value lies within a range.  
2. **Nephews** – Combine logic to evaluate family conditions.  
3. **Grades and points** – Use `if/elif/else` ladders for multiple scenarios.  
4. **FizzBuzz** – The classic challenge using modulo and logic.  
5. **Leap year** – Determine if a year is a leap year based on divisibility.  
6. **Alphabetically in the middle** – Check if a string falls alphabetically between two others.  
7. **Gift tax calculator** – Apply different tax rules based on amount ranges.

### 🔁 Simple Loops
1. **Shall we continue?** – Basic `while` loop with user input.  
2. **Input validation** – Loop until user provides valid input.  
3. **Fix the code: Countdown** – Debug a simple countdown loop.  
4. **Repeat password** – Ask for password confirmation in a loop.  
5. **PIN and number of attempts** – Count how many times it took to enter correct PIN.  
6. **The next leap year** – Loop until a future leap year is found.  
7. **Story** – Interactive loop that builds a story with inputs.  
8. **Working with numbers** – Loop to do math operations based on inputs.
