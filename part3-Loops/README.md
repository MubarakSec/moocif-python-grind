### 🔡 Strings & Input Logic
1. **Word twice** – Simple string duplication  
2. **Only the word 'please'** – Conditional logic with strings

11. **From number to one** – Countdown from input value  
12. **Number pyramid** – Create triangle-style patterns  
13. **Even powers of two** – Combine math and loop filters  
14. **Factorial** – Classic factorial calculator  
15. **Number of divisors** – Count how many divisors a number has  
16. **Greatest of the numbers** – Find max value in a loop  
17. **Mean** – Calculate average over multiple values  
18. **Password and confirmation** – Dual input validation
