# 📘 Part 3 – Loops, Number Sequences & Strings

This section builds on previous knowledge with a strong focus on **loops**, **numeric patterns**, and **string manipulation**. You’ll create logic that repeats efficiently and work with text and numbers in more complex ways.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- `while` loops and loop control  
- Numeric sequences and arithmetic operations  
- Basic string processing  
- Loop + conditional logic  
- Repeating prompts  
- Nested logic patterns  

---


## 🛠️ Skills Strengthened

- Repetition with controlled logic  
- Numeric problem solving  
- Pattern recognition  
- Working with user-defined input ranges  
- Applying math operations dynamically  
- Looping with text-based inputs

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges That Matter

- 🔒 Simulate secure logins  
- 🧮 Recreate math patterns from scratch  
- 🔄 Understand how iteration builds logic  
- 🧠 Think algorithmically, not just syntactically
